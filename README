virublog Flat_CMS
by vikkio88 <vikkio88@yahoo.it>
a flatCMS with a powerfull and light client written in ruby!

TODO:

Before start posting on your flat CMS, you must follow this simple HowTo step by step:

1. Make sure you have your brain connected to other body parts
2. Make sure you have ruby installed
3. Make sure you have a webspace with php5 support
4. Make sure you have something to do with virublog, or you make Jesus to cry!

Ok...
Now for use virublog cms you must edit install.php file on ./virublogOnline dir:

you must edit this 3 variables
		$password= "adminpassword";
		$titolo="Virublog's Engine!";
		$cssfilename= "default.css";

$password =>		
	the first variable contain your cms admin password never forget it! ( if you forget, no problem you can gain it by ftp connection after..)
$titolo =>
	the second contain the cms title, that appears on div id=header of all pages in cms
$cssfilename =>
	contain the css that you use in this blog, go search for other css in the ./virublogOnline/grafica dir for gain other css file name!

after you have edited this 3 variables, you must up all the ./virublogOnline dir on your site (in / directory on in /blog directory...is the same)
Make sure all the directory of online virublog has got writing permission (>=664)

When you finished to up (via ftp) all virublogonline files you must run install.php script, http://yoursite.it/directory/install.php and now, after this virublogOnline can work!

when you have upped all files enter the client dir ./virublog-client and run the configclient.rb script (ruby configclient.rb)

After this configuration your cms is ready to be used!

enter the directory where is virublogclient.rb script and type:
$ ruby virublogclient.rb

and post, or do something you want....
